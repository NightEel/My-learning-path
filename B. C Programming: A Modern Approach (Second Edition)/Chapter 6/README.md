### sum_alternative.c
In page 103 the following is written:\
<i>Also note that there are two identical calls of `scanf`, which is often hard to avoid when using `while` loops.</i> \
Which I don't doubt about but, in that example, it is easy to avoid so I wrote a version that does it.

### numdigits_alternative.c
I don't know if my version is more or less efficient than the original but it is more natural to me.
