### Assignment
<b>Generalized harmonic numbers.</b> Write a program `GeneralizedHarmonic.java` that takes two integer command-line arguments n and r and uses a for loop to compute the nth generalized harmonic number of order r, which is defined by the following formula: \
H(n,r) = 1 / 1^r + 1 / 2^r + ... + 1 / n^r.\
<i>Note:</i> you may assume that n is a positive integer
