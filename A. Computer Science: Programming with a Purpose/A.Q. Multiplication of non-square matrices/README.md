### Assignment
<b>1.4.18</b> Write a code fragment to multiply two rectangular matrices that are not necessarily square.\
<i>Note:</i> For the dot product to be well defined, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. 
Print an error message if the dimensions do not satisfy this condition.

### Instructions
The first 4 inputs must be:
- First: the number of rows in the first matrix.
- Second: the number of columns in the first matrix.
- Third: the number of rows in the second matrix.
- Fourth: the number of columns in the second matrix.\
\
Then, the entries of the matrices, first filling out the rows of the first matrix and finally the second matrix's ones. For example:\
`$ java matricesMultiplication.java 2 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`\
multiply the matrices
<pre>
3 4     and     7 8
5 6             9 10.
</pre>
