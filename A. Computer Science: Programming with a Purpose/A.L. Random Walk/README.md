### Assignment
<b>1.3.37</b> <i>2D random walk.</i> A two-dimensional random walk simulates the behavior
of a particle moving in a grid of points. At each step, the random walker moves north,
south, east, or west with probability equal to 1/4, independent
of previous moves. Write a program `RandomWalker` that takes an integer command-line
argument n and estimates how long it will take a random walker to hit the boundary of a
2n-by-2n square centered at the starting point.
