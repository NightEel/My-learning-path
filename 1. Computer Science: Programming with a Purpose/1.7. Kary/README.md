Answer to the exercise 1.3.21 of the book <i>Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach</i>:\
<b>1.3.21</b> Write a program Kary that takes two integer command line arguments i and k and converts i to base k. Assume that i is an integer in Javaâ€™s long data type and that k is an integer between 2 and 16. For bases greater than 10, use the letters A through F to represent the 11th through 16th digits, respectively.
### Note
As the assignment doesn't say anything about negative numbers I've decide to support them.
