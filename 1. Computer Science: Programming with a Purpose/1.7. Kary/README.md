Answer to the exercise 1.3.21 of the book <i>Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach</i>:\
<b>1.3.21</b> Write a program Kary that takes two integer command line arguments i and k and converts i to base k. Assume that i is an integer in Javaâ€™s long data type and that k is an integer between 2 and 16. For bases greater than 10, use the letters A through F to represent the 11th through 16th digits, respectively.
### Notes
As the assignment doesn't say anything about negative numbers I've decide to support them.\
It's not finished yet since it lacks support for the bases 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
